# WebARX

This project was build by Jared Glass (LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jared-glass-0623k/ Twitter: https://twitter.com/GlassJared352) with the goal of creating an Augmented Reality (AR) Business card through using WEBXR and ThreeJs. It was created using Glitch.com and A-Frame in order to streamline the process and utilize A-Frame's features and simplicity.

## What's in this project?

In this project is a simple AR Business card created using A-Frame so that it can be pulled up through a QR code that pulls up the github pages website that it is attached to.

### What was the process I used for this project?

I started out this project using plain threejs with which it quickly became apparent that the project was becoming complicated and I wasn;t able to get many features to work properly so I turned to my peers to see if any of them had any advice or resurces to share and that is what led me to using A-Frame. A-Frame is a Web Framework built for WebXR that is used primarily for building Virtual Reality experiences in HTML but I was able to adapt it to use with my AR buisness card. A-Frame was designed to allow anyone the ability to create VR websites and games quick and easily through several prebuild commands. All it took to put A-Frame in my project was to add a simple line of code to my Header: <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.2.0/aframe.min.js"></script>. With this simple script tag I was able to add A-Frame into my project and with it I was able to quickly build a working Businesss card that I hope to build onto in the future!
